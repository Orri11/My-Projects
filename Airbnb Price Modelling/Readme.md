The learning goal of the ADAMS course was to get familiarized with recent developments in deep learning and to enable 
us to use the corresponding methodology for solving real-world problems. 
In accordance with this objective, the evaluation of the module is based on the following assignment, which will consist of a 
Jupyter notebook that includes all steps that we typically encounter in a machine learning pipeline 
(explanatory data analysis, data preparation, parameter tuning, etc.).

Modeling task: 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for accommodation rental founded in 2008. 
Properties hosted on the Airbnb platform are owned by private companies and individuals. 
The hosts determine the rental price themselves and pay a service fee to Airbnb. 
In this assignment, we were asked to predict property prices for Airbnb listings in London. We were provided with data on more than 55.000 
properties containing the listing attributes (e.g., location, number of rooms, property type), texts with the listing description, 
and rental price per night. Using a broad range of NLP techniques, we were asked to build an NN-based model that predicts the price of 
listings in the test set based on both text and tabular data. 
For possible further refining of the model's accuracy, we received additional data containing the listing reviews. 

File descriptions:
The data consists of three .csv files containing different information:
The data consists of three .csv files containing different information:
train.csv: training set with listing features, description, and prices
test.csv: test set with listing features and description
reviews.csv: reviews for listings in both training and test set
